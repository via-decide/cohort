Repair mode for repository via-decide/cohort.

TARGET
Validate and repair only the files touched by the previous implementation.

TASK
Build the Synchronized Multi-User Decision Engine (via-group-vote). 1. Create a WebSocket-based voting system where an entire Cohort watches the same interactive video simultaneously on viadecide.com. 2. Implement a "Majority Rule" or "Consensus" logic that tallies live votes and automatically forces the video player to the winning narrative branch. 3. Build a "Live Chat & Emoji Overlay" that syncs with the video's timeline so users can react to specific dramatic moments together.

RULES
1. Audit touched files first and identify regressions.
2. Preserve architecture and naming conventions.
3. Make minimal repairs only; do not expand scope.
4. Re-run checks and provide concise root-cause notes.
5. Return complete contents for changed files only.

SOP: REPAIR PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Strict Fix Only: Do not use repair mode to expand scope or add features.
2. Regression Check: Audit why previous attempt failed before proposing a fix.
3. Minimal Footprint: Only return contents for the actual repaired files.
